YAML ('YAML Ain't Markup Language') w/ Python
- source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
- not 'Yet Another Markup Language' - to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup
- human-readable data serialization language
- configuring stuff
- very much like XML but minimalistic (syntax-wise)

- PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for Python [https://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation]
	- completely Python 3+ compatible 
	- preinstalled w/ Anaconda3 (if not >pip install pyyaml ; or from the source)
	- import library: >import yaml
